<p>AllPlayers is an open-source software platform that seamlessly links organizations and their membership together in one unified environment. One of the many features organizations may utilize within the AllPlayers platform is our e-commerce solution. The e-commerce solution provides support for individual product sales, as well as other services like registrations, donations and membership dues.</p>

<p>It is very important for you as a user of the AllPlayers.com platform to understand that all purchases made on the platform are made between you and the organization from which you are purchasing products or joining, and NOT AllPlayers.com. Each organization selling products or services has their own merchant account, and is solely responsible for all refunds, returns or exchanges. AllPlayers does not capture, maintain, store or have access to your purchase information; therefore, we cannot issue refunds, returns or exchanges.</p>

<p>Each organization using the e-commerce solution must have its own policies and procedures, which are included on your purchase receipt, confirmation email and displayed at the time of purchase.

<p>If you have any questions about your purchase, please use the contact group admin button on the group page.</p>
