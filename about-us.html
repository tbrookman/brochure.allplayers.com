<p><b>AllPlayers.com was started by parents, coaches and community leaders</b> who saw a technology void and wanted to establish a definitive solution to the communication problems we experienced every day. We wanted to make it easy and free, so everyone could use these services regardless of financial or technical challenges.</p>
