<p>Online privacy and security is paramount to us, that’s why we’ve implemented a program we call Guardian Watch which allows parents to act on behalf of and monitor their children’s AllPlayers.com accounts. This transparency provides parents with a full picture of their child’s online activity within the confines of the AllPlayers.com application.  Every child under age 13 is required to have a guardian with an account on AllPlayers.com.</p>

<p>All material and data stored within AllPlayers.com is securely encrypted (thus the reason for the https: in the URL) and will never be shared with anyone. Ever. All group information and content is compartmentalized in Amazon’s EC2 cloud. If we could put guard dogs, moats filled with crocodiles and cannons outside the walls of your AllPlayers.com groups, we would.</p>

<p>In addition to Guardian Watch, AllPlayers.com is a proud partner of the National Child ID Program which provides inkless fingerprint identification kits for families across the nation.</p>
